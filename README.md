It's a really small maze game with no objective.

Allowed graphic library is MiniLibX.

Controls: WASD to move, left and right arrows to rotate point of view, ESC - exit.

Display different wall textures that vary depending on which side the wall is facing (North, South, East, West).

Program takes a scene description .cub file as a first argument. It contains paths to textures, floor and ceiling colors and a map.

The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, and N,S,E or W for the playerâ€™s start position and spawning orientation. The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.
